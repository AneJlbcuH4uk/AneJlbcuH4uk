### 👋 Hi there!

I'm a beginner Unity Developer with a background in Mathematics. I didnt get lucky with people whom I worked with,
so my projects were made only by me. Sometimes I`m solving problems on Codewars here is my badge.

🎮 My first finished project is **Jigsaw Puzzle**, a classic puzzle game made fully in Unity.  
🧩 I also keep a collection of selected **university labs** that show my coding and math skills.
